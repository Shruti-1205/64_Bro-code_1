### Problem Statement chosen : 
(To solve problems of education)
As we know, due to COVID-19 various regions of the world were heavily affected in the Education Sector. Today our education system faces a lot of issues like lack of proper transportation to school, basic infrastructure, qualified teachers, quality of education, low awareness of importance of education, students lack concentration, students are not serious about education. etc are just a small portion of challenges which holds back the development. Develop an AI/ML model to solve one or many issues from the dataset for teachers as well as students.
***
### Understanding of Problem Statement: 
The problem is that there are no regular school meals, irregular schedule followed by teachers, deterioration of basic services of school, people could not afford food and other needs during COVID 19. We will try to analyze the patterns that affect students and teachers' conditions.
***
### Proposed Solution:
We will analyze the condition of various states and those that affect the students and suggest the required changes. We propose to create a web app that will monitor the attendance of the teachers and disclose the problems faced by teachers(upload images of irregular infrastructure, meals). The teachers can have a forum for the discussion of the problems.Predicting the conditions which might affect the students to drop out of the college/school.
